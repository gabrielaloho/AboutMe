    <string name="about_me_bio">Before joining New Horizon as a Course Instructor, I worked mostly in Pastoral
        and Teaching roles through volunteering for Churches and schools. In 2018, I switched my career to Tech
        and began training in software development in 2020.Thanks to Google, Andela and  Pluralsight I completing
        the Android Developer Track in November 2020 through the Google Africa Developer Scholarship (GADS) 2020.
        In my present role, I exercise a calculated and methodical approach to teaching software development,
        code writing, testing and bugging. While I am independently motivated, I appreciate collective efforts and
        collaborate productively within group settings. Moreover, I am competent in WordPress, HTML, CSS, Java and
        Python with a little preference for Linux over other operating systems.!
