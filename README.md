A Simple Biography appplication to teach seconadry school Android App with Kotlin. The students are expected to duplicate the same steps and make their own personalized applications.
The App implements a Spalsh screen. I used scrollView with a linear layout, a simple Image view and Textview. I dont want to get too complex for now, so I didnt touch the Imageview or text view
